# Automated-Flipkart-Price-Tracker

The Automated Flipkart Price Tracker is a handy tool for savvy online shoppers who want to keep an eye on product prices and get the best deals on Flipkart. Built using Beautiful Soup, a Python library for web scraping, this tool empowers users with the ability to monitor and receive notifications about price drops on their favorite Flipkart products.

Key Features:

Web Scraping: The tracker uses web scraping techniques to fetch real-time pricing information for specific products listed on Flipkart. It extracts data from the product's page, including the current price, product name, and availability.

Product Monitoring: Users can add products they're interested in tracking by providing the product's URL or unique identifier. The tracker then periodically checks Flipkart for updates on these items.

Price Change Alerts: When the price of a monitored product drops below a predefined threshold set by the user, the tracker automatically sends an email notification. This feature ensures that users never miss out on discounts or promotions.

Customizable Tracking: Users can configure the frequency of price checks and the specific price threshold for notifications, giving them full control over their tracking preferences.

User-Friendly Interface: The tool is designed with an intuitive user interface that allows users to easily add, modify, or remove products from their watchlist. It also displays a history of price changes for each tracked item.

How It Works:

Adding Products: Users paste the URL or product identifier of the Flipkart product they want to monitor into the tracker's interface.

Setting Price Thresholds: Users specify the desired price threshold at which they would like to be notified of a price drop. This threshold can be adjusted at any time.

Automated Tracking: The tracker regularly scrapes Flipkart's website to check for price updates on the monitored products.

Notification: When the price of a product falls below the user's specified threshold, the tracker sends an email notification with a link to the product page, allowing the user to quickly take advantage of the discounted price.

Benefits:

Save Money: Users can take advantage of price drops and discounts to save money on their favorite products.

Convenience: The tool automates the price tracking process, eliminating the need for manual checks and constant monitoring.

Stay Informed: Users are always informed about the latest price changes, ensuring they don't miss out on deals.

The Automated Flipkart Price Tracker is a valuable companion for online shoppers who want to make informed purchasing decisions and secure the best prices on Flipkart's vast selection of products.
